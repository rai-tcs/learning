📑 Why these sources?

Official LeetCode topic lists let us filter the latest problems by tag (e.g., String, DP). These pages are the most authoritative way to assemble a level‑wise, topic‑wise index. [leetcode.com], [leetcode.com]
LeetCode “Top Interview 150” and the Explore cards identify high‑frequency classics across topics (arrays/strings, trees/graphs, DP). [neetcode.io], [leetcode.com]
NeetCode 150 provides a pattern‑oriented map (arrays, sliding window, stack, binary search, graphs, DP), which is perfect for grouping problems by technique and topic. [leetcode.com]
Company‑wise frequency lists (2025) help weight selection toward most‑asked problems (Two Sum, Group Anagrams, Course Schedule, etc.). [leetcode.com], [walkccc.me]
DP community indexes and Discuss curation supply deep DP subcategories, ensuring that the DP chunk of the 500‑list is complete and modern. [codinginte...viewai.com], [brianhliou.github.io]


📥 Deliverable: Excel Workbook (Top 500, Level & Topic Wise)
I can generate a multi‑sheet Excel with:

Sheets per topic (Array & String, Graphs, DP, etc.).
Columns: #, Problem Title, Difficulty, Topic(s), Pattern, LeetCode Link, Notes.
Filters for difficulty and tags; links open the problem page directly.
Balanced counts per sheet to total ~500 problems.

The selections will be compiled from the sources above to ensure coverage + frequency + recency (topic pages and curated tracks). [leetcode.com], [leetcode.com], [neetcode.io], [leetcode.com], [leetcode.com]
